# üéÑ Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024), an annual series of Christmas-themed programming puzzles.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an advent calendar of programming puzzles that can be solved in any programming language. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released with two parts. These challenges cover a variety of algorithmic problems and data structures.

## Repository Structure

Each day's challenge is in its own directory inside the `challenges` folder:
- `1/` - Day 1 solutions
- `2/` - Day 2 solutions
And so on...

## Running Solutions

Navigate to the day's directory and run:

```bash
node index.js
```
